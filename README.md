# prediction-of-diabetes-using-machine-learning
in this project, we have used different machine learning model to make a predictive and detection system for diabetes.here we have used different models,checked the accuracy with different model and compared the accuracy of all model.the conclusion we got to know is that RANDOM FOREST model gave us a good accuracy.
this project will be of great help to medical sector and also individual person.
